# QuietLine

## What It Is
QuietLine is a minimalist 90‑second calming ritual designed for men who need a fast, private reset.  
No accounts. No noise. No pressure. Just stillness, on demand.

QuietLine is not a habit tracker or a wellness feed.  
It is a moment you can return to when things get loud.

## Core Experience

### Quiet Time
A 90‑second guided breathing session with calm motion, subtle audio, and grounded pacing.  
This is the heart of the app and can be used anytime, without limits.

### First‑Time Experience (FTUE)
New users are gently guided through their first Quiet Time with a one‑time introduction.  
The goal is clarity, not motivation.

Once completed:
- The guide never reappears
- The app becomes fully self‑directed

### Results & Affirmation Unlock
After completing Quiet Time, users are shown:
- A short reflection acknowledging the session
- A newly unlocked affirmation card

The affirmation reveal uses intentional pacing and motion to reinforce calm, not excitement.

### Home Screen
The Home screen provides:
- A single affirmation card
- A central Quiet Time button
- A quiet visual environment with no calls to action

There is no “next step” pressure. Quiet Time is always available.

## Streaks (Quiet by Design)
QuietLine includes a simple daily streak counter:
- Increases only when Quiet Time is completed
- No reminders
- No penalties
- No gamification

Streaks are meant to acknowledge presence, not enforce behavior.

## Philosophy
QuietLine is built on restraint.

Clarity beats features.  
Calm beats motivation.  
Presence beats productivity.

The goal is not to change the user.  
The goal is to give them a place to return to.
