# Bloom

## What It Is
Bloom is a minimalist 90‑second calming ritual designed for men who need a fast, private reset.  
No accounts. No noise. No pressure. Just stillness, on demand.

Bloom is not a habit tracker, a wellness feed, or a productivity tool.  
It is a moment you can return to when things get loud.

---

## Core Experience

### Bloom Time
A 90‑second guided breathing session with calm motion, subtle audio, and grounded pacing.  
This is the heart of the app and can be used anytime, without limits.

### First‑Time Experience (FTUE)
New users are gently guided through their first Bloom Time with a one‑time introduction.  
The goal is clarity, not motivation.

Once completed:
- The guide never reappears
- The app becomes fully self‑directed

### Results & Affirmation Unlock
After completing Bloom Time, users are shown:
- A short reflection acknowledging the session
- A newly unlocked affirmation card

The affirmation reveal uses intentional pacing and motion to reinforce calm, not excitement.

### Home Screen
The Home screen provides:
- A single affirmation card
- A central Bloom Time button
- A quiet visual environment with no calls to action

There is no “next step” pressure. Bloom Time is always available.

---

## Design Constraints (Intentional Limits)

Bloom is built with explicit constraints to protect calm and prevent feature creep:

- No accounts
- No analytics
- No cloud sync
- No social features
- No performance dashboards
- No habit pressure or streak penalties

Every feature must justify its presence by reducing noise, not adding it.

---

## Streaks (Bloom by Design)
Bloom includes a simple daily streak counter:
- Increases only when Bloom Time is completed
- No reminders
- No penalties
- No gamification

Streaks acknowledge presence. They do not enforce behavior.

---

## Navigation

### Bottom Navigation
- Home
- Central Bloom Time button

Nothing else is surfaced by default.

### Side Menu
- About Bloom
- Visit Website
- Support
- Call 988 (U.S.)
- Privacy Policy
- Terms of Service

## Technical Posture

Bloom favors stability and restraint over rapid iteration.

- Built with Flutter, iOS‑first in release focus
- Local‑only persistence; no user data leaves the device
- Minimal, well‑understood dependencies
- Platform‑native security and encryption only
- Updates are intentional and infrequent

This repository is designed to stay boring, predictable, and trustworthy.

---

## Privacy & Data
- No accounts
- No analytics
- No tracking
- No cloud storage

All data is stored locally on the device.

Bloom is private by default.

---

## What Bloom Is Not
- No subscriptions (yet)
- No monetization
- No social features
- No progress dashboards
- No performance metrics
- No growth loops

If a feature adds urgency, comparison, or pressure, it does not belong here.

---

## Philosophy
Bloom is built on restraint.

Clarity beats features.  
Calm beats motivation.  
Presence beats productivity.

The goal is not to change the user.  
The goal is to give them a place to return to.
