# QuietLine

## Description
QuietLine is a 90 second calming ritual made for men who need a moment to breathe. It is a private one tap reset designed to steady the mind and quiet the noise. No accounts, no pressure, no friction.

## Overview
QuietLine is built on a simple idea. When life becomes loud, men need a fast and private way to slow down. The app delivers a guided breathing ritual called Quiet Time, supported by calm motion, grounded design, and a steady tone that feels safe.

The goal is not to track everything or overwhelm the user. The goal is to create a quiet space they can return to every day.
